The Scalar API allows you to easily extend the Scalar framework to adapt it to your own needs,
and allows you to perform scalability tests of your own system.
In order to extend the Scalar platform, the following classes are relevant.
<ul>
<li>{@link be.kuleuven.distrinet.scalar.users.User} allows you to implement custom user behavior,
i.e., "use cases" against which the scalability of the system will be tested.
<li>{@link be.kuleuven.distrinet.scalar.requests.Request} classes are the way by which
user objects interact with the system under test.
<li>{@link be.kuleuven.distrinet.scalar.data.DataProvider} classes realize inter user and
inter node communication and synchronization.
<li>{@link be.kuleuven.distrinet.scalar.core.Plugin} allows you to extend the core
framework functionality. Examples of tasks that are typically performed by a plugin are
configuring a service, cleaning up a database, synchronizing time, etc.
</ul>
