# K8-Scalar
K8-Scalar is an easy-to-use and extensible workbench
exemplar for implementing and evaluating different self-adaptive
approaches to autoscaling container-orchestrated services. 

The K8-Scalar artifact has been used and validated in the context of
autoscalers for database clusters. Although autoscalers for database
clusters  or multi-tier applications  have been researched, developing
an effective autoscaler for databases is still an art, rather than a
science.
